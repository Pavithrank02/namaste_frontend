# State Management + Libraries
  - UI layer recieves data from the data layer
  - UI layer is controlled by the data layer
  - because of the dynamic behaviour of single page application, the state is used to controll such behaviour
  - local state is any dynamic data in the component level. 
  - props drilling is passing the data from parfents to childrens
  - lifting the state up, data can be passed between siblings
  - Libraries
    - Redux
    - Zustand
  - Content API for avoiding props drilling
